# FunPlotter - A web app for plotting univariate functions

:warning: Work currently in progress! :warning:

_FunPlotter_ is a single-page web app for plotting univariate functions on a
canvas.

_FunPlotter_ has been developed as my final project for
[Harvard's CS50x 2024](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/).
