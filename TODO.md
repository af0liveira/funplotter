# TODO list

- Bug fix: allow functions to have constant values
    - A the moment, if a number is entered as a function, an exception is
      thrown:
      > TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

- Implement input validation and error handling
    - At the moment, any unknown expression or invalide data type will crash the
      application
    - The function is generated by simply using `eval(expr)`, which is
      potentially hazardous to the application itself

- Implement default values for lower and upper x limits

- Improve frontend
    - Responsiveness
    - Layout
    - Aesthetics
